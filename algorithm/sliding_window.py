# Sliding windows code template is most used in substring match or maximum/minimum problems.
# It uses two-pointer as boundary of sliding window to traverse, and use a counter(dict) maintain current state,
# and a count as condition checker, update it when trigger some key changes.
#
# Time:  O(n)
# Space: O(k) k = len(set(p))
